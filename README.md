Web application to generate a random password based on user criteria

Based on user input for criteria, this application will generate a randomized password. While the basic concepts are simple enough, joining them all together was a challenge. The main meat of this application is the if, else if statements used to decide which characters would be used via user confirmation. As well as a few if statements handling all negative inputs or incorrect inputs. After that the use of some "empty" variables and concatenation, I was able to make only a single for loop to randomize all of the different characters. The final touches being a function to join the randomized characters to the password variable.
